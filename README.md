In this repository, I have done 4 projects. They are:
1. diabetes prediction
2. sales prediction based on ads
3. handling missing data in hr dataset
4. water potability test

1. diabetes prediction:
Here, I have used ML algorithm to classify diabetes. I implemented both Support Vector Classifier(SVC) and Logistic Regression and concluded Logistic Regression is better than SVC in the used dataset. 
I applied Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) for feature selection, performed data cleaning, feature engineering, implemented SVC, Logistic Regression models and for evaluation, i calculated recall score, precision score, f1 score, confusion matrix.  

2. sales prediction based on ads
In this project, I have applied Linear Regression to predict sales based on TV ads and built a streamlit apllication for it. Also, applied feature selection and predicted sales using both single and multiple feature. I have applied all Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge for prediction.
I have evaluated the model using mean squared error, mean absolute error and r2 score.

3. handling missing data in hr dataset
In the dataset of hr.csv, I have done necessary feature selection, data cleaning and applied and compared two Ml algortihms Logistic Regression and SVC and evaluated using f1 score, recall score, precision score and confusion matrix. In this I have handled the missing data by deletio, mean/median replacement. I concluded SVC to be the best model among two by the evaluation factors.
